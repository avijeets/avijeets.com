        <title>Qualia - Mindful mood tracking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a philosophy course during my senior year at Rutgers called &lt;a href=&quot;https://philosophy.rutgers.edu/197-undergraduate/course-descriptions/fall-2016/826-phil-329-minds-machines-and-persons&quot;&gt;Mind, Machines, and Persons&lt;/a&gt; which opened my eyes to the implications that face a society that adopts technology as quickly as it has. A ubiquitous experience is feeling consistently lonely while society is more closely connected online than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are unique individual experiences to the many advancemenets of technology, such as split views on the potential rise of AI guiding society, that can be classified as &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Philosophers often use the term ‘qualia’ to refer to the introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project came about from the notion of capturing the billions of qualia to everyday phenomena. I started off by building the foundation for an iOS application that could store journal entries and displaying them in an engaging manner. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryans.exposed/&quot;&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; helped take the project to the next level with a great sense of design. We added functionality for logging your mood on a subjective scale, and made the journal entry feature optional for saving a post. Furthermore with the data captured from the mood entry, we built in a line chart that would dynamically update and show the mood progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;Privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was extremely important for us to make privacy the main focus given the nature of journalling being a very personal experience. Obviously, using a remote database to store user entries were immediately ruled out. Fortunately there was a great solution for data persistence  on iOS applications that wasn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/05/09/the-laws-of-core-data/&quot;&gt;Core Data&lt;/a&gt; called Realm. I built in the functionality for Realm to store the entries on the device itself which keeps the entire application experience secure and private (and available offline!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this provides a better experience for users, it is impossible for us to leverage user data to grow the application the way users would want.  Without using a remote database, it is impossible for developers to see into user entries (good) but there isn’t a potential to use analytics or machine learning to better understand user behavior (bad). In fact with all entries being stored on the device, all user data can be lost by simply deleting the application or getting a different device. We built in a feature within the application to export entries to a CSV format to combat the issue of losing all user data. However, this is a risk we are more than willing to take with Qualia. Privacy is inherently important with the rise of technology and I’d be happier with slower growth if that meant for a safe, secure, and private user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on gathering user feedback on the current prototype and implementing features that would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Job Explorer - Quickly filter GitHub Jobs API results</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A straightforward full-stack application that parses the GitHub Jobs API based off two user-inputted fields of job role and location. The application is built with Node.js, Express, and EJS to take in the API endpoint based off of the user inputs and display the objects that are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FocusLoop - Productivity tracking with watchOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while, I have thought about how great and straightforward Apple Watch’s Activity loops are with displaying your daily physical activity. Imagine there was a similar diagram for your productivity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For optimal productivity, I like to set hourly goals ensuring I have something to consistently deliver to keep me on track. FocusLoop lets users set notification routines (triggered every X hours) asking if you are indeed staying productive. If the user prompts yes, the dialog box disappears. If the user prompts no, it brings you to a table of common distractions to let you log what kept you from your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paired iOS application then shows (and persists, shout out Core Data) you the log of what held you from your hourly deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SpellCheck - Using Bloom Filters to recommend fixes to typos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Rutgers Computer Science course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/principles-of-programming-languages&quot;&gt;Principles of Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to learn more about programming language paradigms and how their compilers are built to execute in a specified manner. The coursework delved deep into Functional Programming with Scheme for a good portion of the course, and students were able to build out projects in a completely new approach. For example, we implemented a smart spell check which uses the probabilistic data structure, Bloom Filters, to determine if the word is potentially in a set of properly-spelled words.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Betadrop - Qualitative feedback system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Kyle Ryan and I spent months researching the dearth of quantitative and qualitative feedback prevalent in modern technology platforms. As engineers learning the mobile iOS platform, our mission became:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Build a system that makes it easy for people to get feedback in order to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did research on feedback pools and eventually delved down the path to solving three major findings: using gestures to provide feedback easier, building a novel feedback interface, and  visualizing results that could be understood at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ConnectFour - Zero sum game for iMessage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the developer conference WWDC in 2016, Apple had announced the release of an entire App Store comprised of applications solely meant to be shared with another recipient via iMessage. This announcement opened the doors for stickers, games, and posts to be shared between individuals/groups. My friend Amar and I decided to try out building the collaborative zero-zum ConnectFour game solely through the new iMessage API. Before the iOS had publicly launched and the iMessage App Store was eventually unveiled, Amar and I had finished our working copy of the ConnectFour game playable between two iMessage accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Potential breaking points are iPads and group chats!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tinkering with technology to turn impossibile ideas into tangible products, especially ones that can empower people. I am a Software Engineer in New York City, currently working as an iOS Engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthfirst.org&quot;&gt;Healthfirst&lt;/a&gt;. My technical interests include Full-Stack web applications, iOS application development, and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The languages I love to build applications with are Swift, Python, and Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I have a deep appreciation for art that pushes the needle forward, speaks volumes subtly, and exudes creativity. I’ve spent countless hours exploring the diverse works of UI/UX design, music production, street photography, and fashion. A selected few artists that hold great influence on me are &lt;a href=&quot;http://atribecalledquest.com/&quot;&gt;A Tribe Called Quest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonesthrow.com/madlib&quot;&gt;Madlib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattstuart.com/photography&quot;&gt;Matt Stuart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.ronniefieg.com/blogs/news&quot;&gt;Ronnie Fieg&lt;/a&gt;. I am known to collect vinyl records and sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed my undergraduate degree in Informatics, with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction, with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy from &lt;a href=&quot;http://rutgers.edu&quot;&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; in New Brunswick, NJ. My course work included Principles of Programming Languages, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Philosophical Logic, Database Management Systems, and Computer Architecture. I served as President of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rumad.club/&quot;&gt;Rutgers Mobile App Development Club&lt;/a&gt;, coordinating workshops and mentor programs for students interested in applying Computer Science theory to iOS and Android platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
