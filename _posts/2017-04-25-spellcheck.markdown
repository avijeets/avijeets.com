title: Spell Check with Bloom Filters
tags: [Scheme, functional-programming]
---

In the Rutgers Computer Science course, [Principles of Programming Languages](https://github.com/avijeets/SlackLyrics), I was able to learn more about programming language paradigms and how their compilers are built to execute in a specified manner. The coursework delved deep into Functional Programming with Scheme for a good portion of the course, and students were able to build out projects in a completely new approach. For example, we implemented a smart spell check which uses the probabilistic data structure, Bloom Filters, to determine if the word is potentially in a set of properly-spelled words.
